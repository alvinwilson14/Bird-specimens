📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bird species distribution and diversity across forest and grassland ecosystems. 
It focuses on assessing habitat impact, species trends, and conservation insights using observational data.

🔍 Objectives

-->Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Standardizing and structuring multi-sheet Excel datasets.

-->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying species distribution, trends, and key environmental factors.

-->Data Visualization: Using charts, graphs, and maps to represent species diversity.

-->Geographic & Species Analysis: Understanding habitat impact and biodiversity variations.

-->Insights for Conservation: Providing data-driven recommendations for conservation and land management.


🛠️ Tech Stack

1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

2.SQL (Data querying and storage)

3.Power BI (For interactive dashboards)


📂 Dataset

(-->)Multi-sheet Excel files with bird observation records, environmental conditions, and observer trends.
